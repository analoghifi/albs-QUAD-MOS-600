### Marketing-text:  
  
Although the QUAD-MOS 600 with its continuous RMS power output of 600 watts is not exactly one of the weakest examples of its kind, it is by no means to be regarded as a pure "power amplifier". Rather, it was developed as a "high-end audiophile power amplifier" and is built exclusively from tightly toleranced components.
Its strength lies not only in its extraordinary resolution and detailed, sensitive music reproduction, but also in its almost load-independent stability.
This was achieved by a newly developed input circuit with an IC as well as a gege coupling line, which allows for a higher signal processing speed. Ten power transistors, interconnected by an aluminium plate on the output side, are driven by well-tried linear current mirror drivers. This configuration, in conjunction with 3 16A relays connected in parallel, ensures an enormous current potency, which on the one hand benefits power-hungry, inefficient loudspeaker cabinets, and on the other hand impedance-critical, low-impedance transducer systems, e.g. magnetostats.
The features described below can only unsatisfactorily reflect the musicality and power of this product:
* Balanced and unbalanced signal processing of preamps, mixers and crossovers possible.
* With balanced and unbalanced bridge circuitry, multiple power and double slew rate can be achieved without additional circuitry.
* With inverting control via input B, a control circuit for loudspeakers is possible.
* 6dB filters (CHA, CHB, CTA, CTB) can be used as a crossover for tweeters, woofers or midrange speakers with both unbalanced and balanced control. This means that no additional crossover is needed to activate loudspeaker cabinets with 1st order filters.
* A mono mixer amplifier can be realised via inputs B and C (e.g. as a final stage for mono sub-bass).
* With the resistor RVU any gain from 0db to +3, 6dB can be set. (In case of unbalanced control via input A, B is connected to M).
* Almost any input resistance can be realised via the resistors RVA, RVB, RVC as well as RTA and RTCB. The input sensitivity of the module can also be freely selected via integrated voltage dividers. ( RVA, RVB, RVC are series resistors, RTA, RTBC are divider resistors )
* The preamplifier is fully symmetrical with a high-quality integrated circuit from Burr-Brown and is insensitive to temperature influences and mechanical shocks.
* An extremely linear current mirror driver operates in Class A mode and is cooled by 2 finned heat sinks. The transistors are selected for the same current amplification factor.
* The pre- and driver stage are supplied via separate operating voltages which are smoothed via a gyrator circuit and stabilised by series transistors. Since the supply voltages of the pre- and driver stage are higher than those of the output stage transistors, this results in a better modulation capability in connection with a higher signal slew rate, while the power dissipation of the output stage transistors is reduced. The input circuit is supplied via narrow-tolerance Zener diodes and characteristic-selected series transistors.
* A total of four 10µF special MKP capacitors (two for the pre- and driver stage and two for the output stage transistors) ensure good pulse stability even with low-impedance and complex loads.
* The pre- and driver stage is additionally equipped with 470µF/100V electrolytic capacitors and 2.2µF/100V MKH film capacitors.
* All signal-affecting capacitors are MKH, MKP etc. foil types.
* All operating voltage inputs and the two star-wired earth connections are fitted with nickel-plated brass M4 screw bolts, the Nf inputs and all other necessary connections are fitted with gold-plated pins.
* The loudspeaker output is not routed via conductors as usual, but via a 2mm thick aluminium plate with a cross-section of 64mm2 and can be tapped either via three 16 amp relays connected in parallel or directly at gold-plated brass M4 screw pins bypassing the relays.
* The hermetically sealed relays guarantee a long-lasting, low-impedance contact transition and a constant, high damping factor at the loudspeaker connection.
* All 10 output transistors, now with 160 V dielectric strength, are selected for identical characteristics.
* Overvoltage protection of the output stage transistors against voltage peaks with inductive loads is realised with fast 6 A diodes.
* A partly completely revised, partly new protection circuit ensures immediate disconnection of the loudspeaker if internal or external faults occur.
The following functions are integrated:
    * Switch-on delay of the loudspeaker of 5 sec. to avoid switch-on noises in the loudspeaker.
    * Immediate disconnection of the loudspeaker in case of mains failure longer than 0.3 sec. or when switching off.
    * Shutdown if DC voltage or extreme amounts of infrasound occur in the output signal.
    * Switch-off in case of failure of any operating voltage of pre-driver or output stage.
    * Frequency-independent, delayed switch-off when a presettable output voltage is reached (power limitation).
    * Delay-free switch-off when a presettable switch-off point is reached in the event of oscillation, extreme HF components in the output signal or clipping. (High-frequency protection).
    * Switch-off when the permissible temperature range of max. 90°C is exceeded at the cooling angle.
    * The protection circuit also controls the delayed, but immediate reclosing of the relays when the fault at the output is eliminated.
* The PCB is made of 2.0mm FR-4 base material and coated on both sides with 70µ copper. Solder and component side have a solder mask, the component side also has a position imprint.
* The large ground planes as well as the double-routed wide conductor tracks for the supply voltages enable subsequent enlargement of the conductor track cross-sections as a modification due to tin-plated cut-outs.
* Practical 5-pole Nf connector for all control variants.
